TODO:
 * Rearrange file transfer connections so that they are handled in ConnectionManager
 
 * RendezvousData and FileManager are being handled in a very C-style.  Maybe object orient that a bit so that it looks prettier

 * There appears to be a window between the processing of SNAC 13,06 and the Session being set to _loggedin where
   the client can call SetBuddyIcon and nothing will happen.

 * JoinChatRoom returns ChatRoomInfo right away, but there is a gap between when it's returned and when the actual
   chat room connection is forged. Delayed packets don't exactly work on chat room connections. The CRI should
   probably only be given to the user on a "Joined Chat" event
